1. Why it seems like my initial variables at the top of the page isn't affecting
the game at all, instead, the variables at variable "startGame" (which i assume would apply 
  only when restarting the game after it has ended) are?

2. Why am I still being attacked by the the enemy even after he has been defeated?

3. On "check enemy's health" instead of making the attack value = null after oponent has died
I want to prevent the attack from happening at all
